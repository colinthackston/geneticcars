This is an implementation of a genetic algorithm using Box2D physics package. Our program comes ready to run provided you have
downloaded the libraries and put them into your python path. Our version runs with pythin 2.7 and it has not been tested in 3.0 so it
should probably only be run in 2.7. 

To change the population size, go to line 393 and change it

To change the number of parents, go to line 1012

Data outputed to the screen keeps track of generation average and the records
for highest average and farthest overall distance 

The binary implementation is commented out so please ignore it

One can safely ignore most of the physics implementation

Please do not change the min and max definitions for the car attributes. 
It will break things and produce terrible cars. Or a helicopter 

Also the physics base file is an outline of a GA and is not needed to run the program
